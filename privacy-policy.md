# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: 2024.05.24**

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how O-n-e-D-a-y- ("the App") collects, uses, and protects your information. By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect
The App is designed to be used without requiring an account or collecting personal data. However, certain interactions with the App involve the following:

### 1.1 Personal Information
The App does not require users to create an account and does not collect personal information within the App itself.

### 1.2 Workout Data
The App collects and stores workout data input by the user. This data is stored locally on your device and can be backed up to your cloud storage (Google Drive on Android and iCloud on iOS).

### 1.3 Local Backup
Users can choose to create backups locally within the App's storage on their device. On iOS, these backups are visible inside the "Files" App. On Android, local backups are only accessible within the App itself or through connection to a computer.

### 1.4 Cloud Backup
If you choose to use the cloud backup feature, your workout data will be stored in your Google Drive or iCloud account. The App does not store or have access to this data on its own servers without your permission. If you choose to load a backup you grant acces to those cloud backups.

## 2. Use of Information
The information collected by the App is used solely for the purpose of providing and improving the App’s functionality:

- **Workout Tracking:** To allow you to track and monitor your fitness progress.
- **Backup and Restore:** To provide the option to back up your data to your cloud storage and restore it when needed.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
The App does not share, sell, or disclose your personal information to third parties, except in the following circumstances:

- **Service Providers:** We may share information with third-party service providers who assist us in operating the App, such as cloud storage providers (Google Drive and iCloud).
- **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).

## 4. Data Security
We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your data. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 5. Third-Party Services
The App includes integrations with third-party services (Google Drive and iCloud) for backup purposes. Your interactions with these services are governed by their respective privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services to understand their practices.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal data from a user under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
